# Study Notes on Throttling in JavaScript

## Introduction to Throttling
**Throttling** is a technique used in programming, particularly in JavaScript, to limit 
the number of times a function can be called over time. It's especially useful for 
optimizing performance and managing resource usage.

### Key Points
- **Purpose**: Throttling is primarily used for **performance optimization** and **rate 
limiting** of function calls, ensuring that a function is not called too frequently.
- **Example Scenario**: If a function is triggered by a user action, such as clicking a 
button, throttling ensures that the function can only execute once every specified 
interval (e.g., 500 milliseconds) .

## How Throttling Works
- When a function is called, throttling will delay the next call for a defined period.
- For instance, if a function is triggered at a click event, the next execution will only 
occur after the specified delay (e.g., 500 ms) has passed.

### Visual Representation
- Imagine a timeline where function calls are spaced out:
  - **Click Event 1**: Function executes
  - **Wait 500 ms**
  - **Click Event 2**: Function executes
  - **Wait 500 ms**
  - **Click Event 3**: Function executes

This ensures that even if multiple clicks happen in quick succession, the function will 
only execute at the defined intervals.

## Implementation of Throttling
To implement a throttling function, you typically create a wrapper around the function 
you want to throttle. Hereâ€™s a basic structure:

```javascript
function throttle(func, limit) {
    let lastFunc;
    let lastRan;

    return function() {
        const context = this;
        const args = arguments;

        if (!lastRan) {
            func.apply(context, args);
            lastRan = Date.now();
        } else {
            clearTimeout(lastFunc);
            lastFunc = setTimeout(function() {
                if ((Date.now() - lastRan) >= limit) {
                    func.apply(context, args);
                    lastRan = Date.now();
                }
            }, limit - (Date.now() - lastRan));
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Parameters**:
  - `func`: The function to be throttled.
  - `limit`: The time interval (in milliseconds) to wait before allowing the next 
  execution.
- **Logic**:
  - The function checks if it has been executed recently. If not, it executes immediately.
   If it has, it sets a timeout to execute after the limit has passed.

## Conclusion
Throttling is an essential concept in JavaScript for managing function calls efficiently. 
Understanding how to implement and utilize throttling can significantly enhance the 
performance of web applications, especially in scenarios involving user interactions like 
scrolling or clicking.
