# Notes on Polyfill for Bind Method

## Overview
- The **bind method** is a commonly asked interview question in tech companies. It allows you to create a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to a specific value. 

## Key Concepts
- **Polyfill**: A polyfill is a piece of code that provides functionality that is not natively supported by a browser. In this context, it refers to creating a custom implementation of the `bind` method for browsers that do not support it. 
  
## Implementation Steps
1. **Create an Object**: Define an object with properties (e.g., `firstName`, `lastName`) and a method (e.g., `printName`) that logs the name to the console. 
  
2. **Custom Bind Function**: Implement a function called `myBindFunction` that mimics the behavior of the native `bind` method. This function should:
   - Return a new function.
   - Handle and concatenate arguments properly.
   - Manage the context (`this`) correctly. 

3. **Interview Expectations**: Interviewers look for a clear understanding of how to handle function references, arguments, and context when writing your own implementation of the `bind` method. <chunk>30b76858-3fea-4138-a38a-c4bec345ba2b>

## Conclusion
- Writing a polyfill for the `bind` method is a valuable skill that can impress interviewers. Understanding how to manipulate function context and arguments is crucial for implementing this functionality effectively. <chunk>30b76858-3fea-4138-a38a-c4bec345ba2b>

in this video. For those who don't know what polyfill is, I would like to say that 
polyfill is sort of a browser fallback. So what if suppose your browser doesn't have a 
bing function and you have to write your own bind function that is what we are going to 
do. So, interviewers are expecting you to write your own implementation of the bind 
function. So, I would suggest you to open up your Console and start coding along with me 
Let's dive into the code now Let's create an Object Name

So, it prints the name. So, that's how the traditional bind function works. Our task is 
to write our own implementation of bindMethod, something like a myBindFunction which 
behaves exactly like this bind method over here. What I mean by that is, suppose had let 
so let us copy this so suppose we have print my name to method instead of bind it uses my
